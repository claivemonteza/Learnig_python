When we write star dot py [*.py], 
the shell turns it into a list containing all filenames that end with py in the current directory. 
We can also put the star at the end of an expression to get a list of all files that start with a certain prefix.

echo *.py


c* allows us to get all the files in the current directory that start with c.

echo c*


The star with no prefix or suffix matches all the files in the current directory.

echo *


echo ?????.py
The question mark symbol can be used to match exactly one character, instead of any amount of characters.
We can repeat it as many times as we need. 
In this example, we can get the Python files with five characters in their name by using five question marks together.
